If some extra files like scripts of manpages are needed in the
metapackages they should be placed into apropriate subdirectories of
this directory.  While there is no certain procedure in the blends-dev
tools to handle files in this directory it might be a good idea to
settle down with some default place for those extra files.  To move
them right into place the files debian/<pkg>.install,
debian/<pkg>.manpages etc. should be used.

See for instance Debian Med packages.
