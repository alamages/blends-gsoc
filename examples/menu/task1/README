Here you can place overrides for the package maintainer menu entries
in normal menu syntax as files <dep>.menu .

Sometimes it is not possible to provide a useful menu entry for a
package and thus we would fail to create a menu entry for a dependency
inside a metapackage.  This sucks in term of user support and thus it
is strongly suggested to provide some information about each dependant
package which has no reasonable menu entry.

This can easily done by creating a text file with the name of the
dependency, i.e. dep2.txt.  Alternatively you can provide HTML
formated description as dep3.html.

These files should provide all information which is necessary to use
this package, like man pages online documentation, usage examples,
upstream URL, etc.
